## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**  
   
       git clone https://github.com/Shikhasinghtjp/Todo-App.git
   
       cd Todo-App

2. Run the app

       Open index.html in your browser

       Or serve via a dev server (e.g., VS Code Live Server)

## 🔍 How It Works
Add a task: Enter text in the input field and press "Add" or Enter.

Mark as done: Click the checkbox next to each task—completed items move to the bottom or get styled differently.

Delete a task: Click the delete icon/button next to a task.

Clear completed: Use the "Clear Completed" button to remove all done tasks at once.

Data Persistence: Tasks and statuses are saved in localStorage, so they remain after refreshing.
